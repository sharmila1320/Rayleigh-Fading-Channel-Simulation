🔹 Project 2: Rayleigh Fading Channel Simulation
🎯 Objective:
Simulate a Rayleigh fading wireless channel to visualize how the signal strength varies due to multipath fading — a key challenge that RIS helps overcome.

📐 Background:
In urban or indoor environments, signals reach the receiver through many paths. These paths interfere (constructively or destructively), leading to fast signal fluctuations known as Rayleigh fading.

In complex baseband:

📈 Output:
Envelope plot: Shows how received signal strength fluctuates randomly over time.

Phase plot: Random walk behavior of signal phase.
